# Advent of Code 2021

I am using Python in an Anaconda environment to solve the puzzles provided [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

Follow the steps below to run the code:

* Clone the repo
* Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
* Create a conda environment as follows:
```
conda create --name <env> --file conda_requirements.txt
conda activate <env>
```
